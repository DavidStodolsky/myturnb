## Chrome on Debian, single user test

- doesn't countdown at all when I don't press the button

- only counts down by speaker time if I do press the button, i.e., if time to speak was set to 3, it counts down 3 second intervals.

- always ends at one second remaining, with "Current speaker" set to my name,
if I let it count down to "zero" with button pressed. remains ticking.
